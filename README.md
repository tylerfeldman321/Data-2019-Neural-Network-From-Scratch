# DataPlus-2019-Neural-Network-Exploration
Coding regression and classification machine models from scratch.

## Description
First attempt at creating a two-layer neural network from scratch for classification and regression problems during Duke Data+ 2019. 
Used the iris dataset for classification and a forest fire area dataset for regression. 
There are exploratory data analysis scripts included that aimed to better understand the data. 
Along with the neural networks from scratch, I created models in PyTorch to compare the performances.
